2. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW
===============================

The platform follows a modern microservices-inspired architecture with clear separation of concerns and scalable design patterns:

Frontend Layer (External Integration):
- React.js or Vue.js single-page application
- RESTful API consumption with JWT authentication
- Real-time updates through WebSocket connections (future enhancement)
- Mobile-responsive design for cross-platform accessibility
- Role-based routing and component rendering

Backend Layer (Flask Core):
- Flask web framework with Flask-RESTful for API development
- Application factory pattern for configuration management
- Blueprint-based modular architecture for maintainability
- SQLAlchemy ORM for database abstraction and relationship management
- Marshmallow for data validation and API serialization
- JWT-based authentication with role-based access control
- Celery task queue for asynchronous background processing

Database Layer:
- PostgreSQL as primary relational database for production
- SQLite for development and testing environments
- Redis for caching, session management, and task queue backend
- JSONB columns for flexible content storage (exercise data, user profiles)
- Proper indexing strategy for optimal query performance
- Database migrations managed through Flask-Migrate

External Services Integration:
- OpenAI API for AI-powered tutoring and conversation management
- AWS S3 or local filesystem for file storage and management
- SMTP email services for notification delivery

6. SECURITY & AUTHENTICATION
============================

JWT Token Management (Flask-JWT-Extended):
The platform implements a comprehensive JWT-based authentication system with multiple layers of security:

Token Architecture:
- Access Tokens: Short-lived (15 minutes) for API access and user operations
- Refresh Tokens: Longer-lived (30 days) for seamless token renewal
- Token Blacklisting: Revoked tokens stored in Redis for immediate invalidation
- Automatic Expiration: Built-in token lifecycle management
- Secure Transmission: Tokens transmitted only via Authorization headers

Token Structure and Claims:
{
  "user_id": "uuid-string",
  "role": "student|professor|admin",
  "exp": 1234567890,
  "iat": 1234567890,
  "jti": "token-unique-identifier",
  "fresh": false
}

Password Security (bcrypt):
- Bcrypt hashing with adaptive salt rounds (minimum 12 rounds)
- Password strength requirements enforced on both frontend and backend
- No plain text password storage anywhere in the system
- Secure password reset functionality with time-limited tokens
- Password history tracking to prevent reuse (future enhancement)

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):
The platform implements sophisticated RBAC through custom decorators:

@role_required('professor', 'admin')
def create_exercise():
    """Only professors and administrators can create exercises"""
    pass

@role_required('student')
def submit_answer():
    """Only students can submit exercise answers"""
    pass

@admin_required
def system_analytics():
    """Administrative access required for system-wide analytics"""
    pass

Access Control Matrix:
- Students: Read access to published exercises, own progress, enrolled classes
- Professors: Full CRUD on own exercises and classes, read access to enrolled student data
- Administrators: System-wide access with audit logging and user management

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS):
- Configured for specific frontend origins to prevent unauthorized access
- Credentials support enabled for JWT token transmission
- Restricted to necessary HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS)
- Production configuration limits origins to specific trusted domains
- Preflight request handling for complex CORS scenarios

Rate Limiting (Flask-Limiter):
Comprehensive rate limiting strategy to prevent abuse:
- Global Limits: 200 requests per day, 50 requests per hour per IP address
- Authentication Endpoints: Strict limits (5 login attempts per minute)
- File Upload Endpoints: Capacity-based limits (10 uploads per hour, 100MB total)
- API Endpoints: Category-based limits (exercise creation: 20/hour, submissions: 100/hour)
- Redis-based storage for distributed rate limiting across multiple instances

Input Validation & Sanitization:
- Marshmallow schemas validate all input data with custom validators
- SQL injection prevention through SQLAlchemy ORM parameter binding
- XSS protection through output encoding and Content Security Policy
- File upload restrictions (type whitelist, size limits, content validation)
- CSRF protection for state-changing operations
- Input length limits to prevent buffer overflow attacks

Security Headers Configuration:
- Content Security Policy (CSP): Strict policy preventing XSS attacks
- X-Frame-Options: DENY to prevent clickjacking attacks
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff to prevent MIME type confusion
- X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block for legacy browser protection
- Strict-Transport-Security: HSTS header for HTTPS enforcement
- Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin for privacy

Data Protection Measures:
- HTTPS enforcement in production environments with TLS 1.2+
- Database connection encryption and certificate validation
- Sensitive data exclusion from API responses and logs
- Personal data anonymization in analytics and reporting
- Audit logging for security-relevant actions and data access
- Data retention policies with automatic cleanup procedures

Security Monitoring & Logging:
- Failed authentication attempt tracking with automatic blocking
- Suspicious activity detection (unusual access patterns, multiple failures)
- Security event logging with structured log format
- Real-time alerting for critical security events
- Regular security audit reports and compliance monitoring

7. AI CHATBOT INTEGRATION
=========================

AI Provider Architecture:
